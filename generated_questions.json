Dr Mradul Kaushik, Senior Director & COO Cluster 1 at Max Healthcare, Mr Shanker Kaul, Managing Director at Elsevier, Dr Amit Disawal, secretary ICRI; and Dr Deepak Gupta & Dr Ankur Goyal, President & Secretary of Delhi state Branch of IRIA were the guests of honour at the launch.\n\nIt has been an honour and privilege for me to lead the revision of this book, which was last updated in 2002. The book has been the gold standard and key reference book in Radiology.\u00a0The new Sutton is aimed at recreating an exhaustive resource for radiologists to solve diverse clinical scenarios using the latest and most appropriate techniques.  \n\nThe book was put together through the COVID pandemic, the biggest medical calamity faced by our generation. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the contributors, who, despite being personally and professionally impacted by COVID at the frontlines during the pandemic, stood true to their commitment and contributed high quality material that will lay the foundation for the careers of the radiologists of the future.\n\nI thank my associate Editors, Dr.Amit Kumar Sahu, Dr.Akshay Baheti & Dr. Varsha Joshi for their support and hard work. Our team had the privilege to work with some of the top Radiology educationists as our Section editors, all leaders in their fields - a big thanks to Dr.Suresh K. Mukherji MD MBA FACR, Dr.Suyash Mohan, Dr.Girish Gandikota, Dr.Sandeep Hedgire, Dr.Mukesh Harisinghani, Dr.Sujit Vaidya, Dr.Puneet Bhargava, MD, FAUR, FSAR, FACR & Dr.Subba Digumarthy for their contribution. \n\nI once again thank all the contributors, my family and my colleagues at Max Healthcare for their support!\n\n#SuttonRadiologyTextbook, #Radiology #RadiologyEduction #maxhealthcare #ai",
