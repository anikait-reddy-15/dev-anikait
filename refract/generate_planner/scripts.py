        # Prepare prompt
        prompt = f'''You are a smart SQL planner. Your job is to break down natural language business/tech strategy questions into logical subtasks.

You have access to these structured tables: {', '.join(tables)}.
Each table includes business, tech, leadership, or hiring-related fields, including nested fields like social posts, IT trends, hiring roles, leadership excerpts, etc.

Your task:
For **each question**, decompose it into a JSON object of subtasks to help generate a SQL query step-by-step.

Important:
- Each **subtask must include only the specific table(s)** required to complete **that individual step**.
- Do **not** list all question-related tables inside each subtask â€” only what's used for that step.
- Include a `"tables"` field at the top level with all required tables for the full question.
- Each question must include **at least 3 subtasks** (minimum) to ensure logical breakdown. There's **no upper limit** if more steps are needed.

Return format (per question):

[
  {{
    "question": "<original question>",
    "tables": ["<all tables needed overall>"],
    "subtasks": [
      {{
        "step": 1,
        "task": "Describe what this subtask is doing",
        "table": ["Table1"]
      }},
      {{
        "step": 2,
        "task": "Next subtask description",
        "table": ["Table2"]
      }}
    ]
  }}

"Who are the key leaders at New York Life impacting technology investments in data management strategies?"

        "table": ["CompanyManagementDetail"]
      }},
